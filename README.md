In this work, we have implemented the “An Unsupervised Approach for Segmentation and Clustering Soccer Players”[1] paper and tried some modifications. The main objective was to cluster soccer player images acquired from a static camera. For the beginning, player detection has been performed by means of background subtraction. The next step was to extract features from each player images and provided to a modified version of BSAS(Basic Sequential Algorithm Scheme) clustering algorithm. Each image represents a point in feature space and the algorithm creates clusters for each class of objects by comparing the distance between them.
